<title>Ruffle stuff</title>
<body>
  <p>Here you'll find Flash games. There's an emulator called Ruffle that can run some Flash content on modern browsers.</p>
  <p>It's not 100% compatible, hence the existence of the separate Flash repo.</p>
  <p>We've embedded the player into this site so you can play these games on modern browsers without installing Ruffle.</p>
