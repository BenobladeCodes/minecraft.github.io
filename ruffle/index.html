<title> WIP Ruffle Supported Games</title>
<body>This page is not done and is still being worked on. I suggest to not bother with this page until its done or until its got games on it. We will let you know when its done or when theres at least one playable game on it. But fornow you can just explore it or just ingore it.
  <hr>You do not need ruffle installed as we are going to include it with the games so you can play it straight away without having to install anything.<hr>
