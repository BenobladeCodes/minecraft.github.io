<title> Flash games using Ruffle</title>
<body>This page is not done and is still being worked on.
  <hr>You do not need ruffle installed as we are going to include it with the games so you can play it straight away without having to install anything. Your save data ingame will save aslong as the game supports the function. This will only save it on the computer that you used it on or the computer login that you used it on<hr>
