  <hr>Flash Game Pages:</hr>
  <p><a href="https://catgang42.github.io/ruffle/index.html">Games that work on Ruffle</a></p>
<p><a href="https://catgang42.github.io/flash/index.html">Games that require Flash to run</a></p>

  <hr>Things we gonna do:</hr>
<p>Bloons TD series from 1 to 5, although 5 can't be on ru-ffle as it doesn't support the version of flash that TD5 uses afaik.</p>
<p>This site works on Internet Explorer, and there's a separate repo for games that require Flash.</p>

<hr>Update log:</hr>
<p>Created the update log
<p> Updated Cookie Clicker to the latest version</p>

<hr>Of course we didn't make these games, we're just putting them together so we can access them and anyone else. We are only uploading these games so people can play them if their school has blocked the official sites.</p>
