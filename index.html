  <hr>Things we gonna do:</hr>
<p>Bloons TD series from 1 to 5, although 5 can't be on ru-ffle as it doesn't support the version of flash that TD5 uses afaik.</p>
<p>This site works on Internet Explorer, and we'll make a separate section for games that require Flash.</p>

<hr>IMPORTANT: Of course we didn't make these games, we're just putting them together so we can access them and anyone else. We are only uploading these games so people can play them if their school has blocked the official sites.</hr>
